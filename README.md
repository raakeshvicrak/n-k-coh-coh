n-k-coh-coh is a popular childhood game in a certain rural midwestern town that requires just a board
consisting of a grid of n x n squares and some white and black marbles. Initially the board starts empty
and all marbles are in a pile beside the board. Player 1 picks up a white marble and places it in any square
of the board. Player 2 then picks up a black marble from the pile, and places it in any open square (i.e.
any square except the one selected by Player 1). Play continues back and forth, with Player 1 always using
white marbles and Player 2 always using black. A player loses the game as soon as they place a marble such
that there is a continuous line of k marbles of his or her color in the same row, column, or diagonal of the
board. (For example, note that 3-3-coh-coh is nearly the same as tic-tac-toe, except that players are trying
to avoid completing a row, column or diagonal instead of trying to complete one.)

Thinking! Please wait...
Hmm, I'd recommend putting your marble at row 2, column 1.
